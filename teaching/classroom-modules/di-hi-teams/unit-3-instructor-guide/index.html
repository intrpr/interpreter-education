<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Assessing the need for a DI-HI team typically falls on the shoulders of the hearing interpreter assigned to a particular job because they are often the first on the scene in an interpreted setting. This means that the hearing interpreter is usually the person responsible for first assessing the needs required to successfully interpret in a particular setting. However, it is important for anyone assessing these communication needs to look at several different factors in order to determine if a DI-HI team is required to ensure the D/deaf person’s rights to full linguistic and communicative access are provided. Two of the primary factors to consider will be explored in this unit – the Deaf consumers of the interpreting service and the setting in which these services are to be provided. Though DI-HI teams may be required or beneficial for any consumer or setting. Though this unit cannot include every possible setting where DI-HI teams would be warranted, this unit focuses on 7 categories of consumers and 3 settings. Possible consumers that often require the use of a DI-HI team are divided into the following 7 categories: semi-lingual/alingual, foreign-born, users of International Sign, DeafBlind individuals, those consumers with physical and/or cognitive disabilities (i.e. Deaf Plus), minors, and persons under the influence or experiencing a traumatic event. The 3 settings covered in this unit are: educational, social services, and medical. These settings were chosen based on where novice interpreters are more likely to work and because of their complexity combined with their potential for life-altering outcomes all of which are heavily dependent on linguistic presence and full access. We have also included five additional settings that would be more suited to expert interpreters – employment, mental health, legal, public events, and platform work such as national/international interpreting and/or deafness-related conferences. Activities for these additional settings are provided as well.</p>
<p>In summary, this unit includes a brief discussion on the important impact that a HI’s own skills can have on the need for a DI-HI team as well as a summary of the importance of this assessment.</p>
<p><strong>I) Possible Consumers</strong></p>
<p>Deaf individuals have a variety of language experiences, backgrounds, and skills. When assessing the need for a DI-HI interpreting team, it is essential that an interpreter have familiarity with the variety of possible consumers who may require the use of a DI-HI team in order to ensure their rights to equal access are preserved. In this unit, a variety of possible consumers are briefly discussed, for more in depth information on the topic, please see the resources listed at the end of the unit. It is important to note that the categories listed here are not mutually exclusive as it is possible to have one consumer with multiple factors impacting their language use.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Semi-lingual/alingual</em>: Bienvenu and Colonomos (1992) define these consumers as “…deaf people (alingual) who have not been exposed to any natural language and have devised a limited vocabulary to express their thoughts… Other D/deaf people (semi-lingual) have learned some signs, but their language acquisition was so delayed, or the language input so scarce, that they are not able to express themselves freely, with the depth and precision of natural language” (p. 71). According to the NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team (2010), Deaf interpreters work most frequently with this consumer population. Other labels sometimes used to describe these consumers include Minimal Language Skill (MLS), highly visual, monolingual, low functioning, Limited English Proficiency (LEP), etc. Though these terms may be used in various contexts, the preferred and more appropriate terms are alingual or semi-lingual.</li>
<li><em>Foreign-born</em>: Some Deaf people have immigrated to the US from foreign countries and therefore may have a fluent and native signed language other than ASL as their native language. These potential consumers could also be in the process of acquiring ASL, or they may have no foundation in a signed language whatsoever.</li>
<li><em>Users of International Sign</em>: International Sign (IS) is a system of signs created by a committee of the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) in 1973. It is a system of signs based on choices of the most easily understood signs from a diverse variety of signed languages (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team, 2012). Previously called Gestuno, International Sign is now the preferred term used to describe this created, non-natural signed communication system (Boudreault, 2005). Some possible deaf consumers of interpreting services may be international travelers who have a fluent and native language other than ASL, but may also have an understanding of, and ability to use, International Sign.</li>
<li><em>DeafBlind</em>: DeafBlind consumers can include people with a spectrum of hearing and vision abilities who need specific accommodations in order to access signed language (e.g. tactile interpreting, close or far interpreting, tracking, etc). More information on communication needs and preferences for DeafBlind individuals can be found at <a href="http://aadb.org/factsheets/db_communications.html">http://aadb.org/factsheets/db_communications.html</a>.</li>
<li><em>Deaf Plus</em>: This category of possible consumers would include any Deaf or Hard of Hearing persons who have cognitive and/or physical disabilities that impact their language expression or comprehension such as autism or down syndrome. This category would also include individuals with conditions such as Cerebral Palsy or Muscular Dystrophy, which may impact their ability to produce signs, and may therefore necessitate a DI-HI team.</li>
</ol>
<p>Certain mental illnesses may impact a Deaf person’s ability to produce and comprehend typical ASL and would benefit from a DI-HI team. An example of this would be a Deaf person who experiences hallucinations. There may be very subtle language cues and changes that indicate whether the deaf consumer is signing to their hallucinations or directly to the addressee. This distinction is critical as a misinterpretation may lead to a misdiagnosis.</p>
<ol>
<li>Minors: This includes anyone under the age of 18. Depending on their language environments, education level/background, and age, minors may have varying levels of language competency.</li>
<li>Persons under the influence or experiencing a traumatic event: There may be some Deaf persons who would not typically require the services of a DI-HI team, but for a particular event or setting a DI-HI team would be the best provision of services. Examples include Deaf persons who are heavily under the influence of an intoxicating substance that is impacting their ability to produce and comprehend typical ASL. Or a Deaf person that has experienced a traumatic or excessively stressful event (i.e. physical or sexual assault, the loss of a loved one, etc.) that is impacting their ability to communicate effectively.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>II) Various Settings</strong></p>
<p>This following information pertains to how DI-HI teams work in three specific settings; educational, social services, and medical.</p>
<ol>
<li>Educational Interpreting</li>
</ol>
<p>Education is a vital part in the development of young people and adults alike. Access to education becomes even more important for people with needs for accommodations. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975, amended 2004, along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, require that accommodations be made for people who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing in K-12 and higher education settings.</p>
<p>The educational environments that interpreters work within span a vast range of ages, settings, and content. An interpreter needs to have the awareness and ability to assess each educational setting in order to identify the best communication and interpreting provisions for each situation. In the US, students are more often educated in mainstream environments than in deaf residential schools (Gallaudet Research Institute, 2011). Many of these deaf children are in mainstream settings without any deaf peers, deaf role models, or deaf language models (Oliva, 2004), and in these settings the role of the interpreter in providing appropriate access and language modeling becomes that much more imperative. There may be times when an ASL-English interpreter is not best suited for providing access to a consumer in an educational setting and may make the decision to include a DI on the interpreting team.</p>
<p>Any educational setting in which interpreters work could potentially require a DI-HI team depending on the consumers’ needs. These settings include, but are not limited to, birth-to-three programs, pre-k programs, K-12 programs, vocational training, undergraduate and graduate programs, etc. In the settings where there is a hearing student with Deaf family members, services may be required for the Deaf parents or family members attending school functions, educational planning meetings, etc. It is also possible that Deaf family members will necessitate a DI-HI team.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Social Services</li>
</ol>
<p>Social Service programs include, but are not limited to: Vocational Rehabilitation, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, Child Protective Services, utility assistance programs, food banks, low cost clinics, and housing agencies. There are forms, criteria, and regulations that determine a person’s eligibility for social services. These forms and regulations are not only vast but they can be quite complex. Understanding what is expected of the social service participant is paramount; services will be denied or delayed if forms are not properly filled out or regulations, rules, or criteria are not satisfied. With few laws that mandate the use of an interpreter in social service settings (Humphrey &amp; Alcorn, 2001) access to these services can be difficult, further marginalizing Deaf communities. To add to the complexity, social service settings often include legal and mental health interpreting. Child Protective Services, for example, could begin with a routine home visit that turns into legal questioning or mental health counseling the Deaf parents and/or the child who may be under emotional duress. Due to the complexity and serious nature of these settings, combined with their potential for life-altering outcomes if services are denied, delayed, or inappropriately given, interpreters working in social service settings should consider utilizing a DI-HI team.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Medical Interpreting</li>
</ol>
<p>In the United States, Deaf individuals are granted equal access to health care services through both the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. While we would expect that these two laws have allowed for improved access and a greater understanding of health care issues, studies have shown that this is not the case (Steinberg, Wiggins, Barmada, and Sullivan, 2002). A study conducted in 2002 examined Deaf women’s health care experiences and found that there was a general lack of health knowledge, little understanding or value of common screenings, purposes of prescribed medications or procedures, and negative experiences with insensitive health care providers. Subjects in this particular study reported more “positive experiences and increased access to health information” with medical practitioners who provided qualified interpreters (Steinberg, et al, 2002, p. 729). Moore and Swabey (2007) discuss several other studies which mirror the experiences of women in Steinberg et al.’s study. The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Standard Practice Paper <em>Interpreting in Health Care Settings</em> (2007) lists eight settings “in which the information to be exchanged requires effective communication.” These same settings may require the use of a DI-HI team in order to ensure effective communication and include, but is not limited to: taking a patient’s medical history, giving diagnoses, performing medical procedures, explaining treatment planning, explaining medicine prescription and regimen, providing patient education or counseling, describing discharge and follow up plans, and admitting to emergency departments/urgent care. Specific medical settings and situations will have distinct ramifications on communication and will present specific challenges to interpreting procedures. Most often, problems that arise in the medical setting are “due to differing cultural norms, and the onus falls to the interpreter to make the adjustments required for accurate communication” (Moore and Swabey, 2007, p. 24). DI-HI teams are better equipped at handling these differing cultural norms.</p>
<p>Although three particular setting where DI-HI teams often work are described in this unit, it is also important to recognize that DI-HI teams work in a number of additional settings.  These setting include, but are not limited to: mental health interpreting, legal, public events settings, and national/international interpreting and/or Deafness-related conferences.</p>
<p><strong>III) HI Self-Skill Assessment and Summary for Unit 3</strong></p>
<p>HIs may acquire fluency in ASL and may be viewed as holding partial membership in the Deaf community, however, they often do not have the same level of native fluency and insider acceptance in the Deaf community as DIs. Though a HI could perhaps justify the need for a DI on every interpreting assignment, the practicality of following such an ideal is not realistic. For that reason, HIs must continually assess their skills against the demands of the job to determine when a DI should be included as part of the interpreting team. The NAD/RID Code of Professional Conduct (2005) states that interpreters must assess “the consumers’ needs and the interpreting situation before and during the assignment and make necessary adjustments as needed,” and furthermore, to “request support (e.g., certified deaf interpreters, team members, language facilitators) when needed to fully convey the message or to address exceptional communication challenges.” Typically, it is the HI who is first called in to interpret and therefore they possess the power of deciding whether or not they are able to meet the needs of the consumer involved in a particular setting. For this reason, continual self-assessment to determine suitability for an interpreting assignment is imperative. The mark of a true professional is evidenced by their acknowledgment of the ethical and professional obligation they have to ensure that effective communication access is achieved and in doing so continually assess their strengths and abilities against the demands of the interpreting job. Recognizing that a DI-HI team is needed and taking steps to secure such a team is the sign of a professional, ethical interpreter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Would you recommend a DI-HI team for this appointment?<br />
<strong>ANSWER: </strong>Yes<br />
If yes, continue answering questions 2 – 6; if no, jump to question 7:2. What about the consumer and his language use in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> The consumer is a very young child who is profoundly deaf but comes from a home that does not sign. At this point, an interpreter is unable to assess his language background or competency, but with only a short time being enrolled in the School for the Deaf, it seems likely that the child has little ASL fluency. Because DIs have had lifelong experiences and exposure to Deaf people with different language backgrounds they have been afforded opportunities to be exposed to and interact with individuals using countless variations and dialects of ASL. From this foundation of language variation and exposure, a DI would be able to recognize any linguistic factors and communication needs that may likely influence the interpretation. A DI team would bring language assessment expertise to the setting, and if the child is lacking in language proficiency, the DI could present information in a more visually-centric manner..3. What about the interpreters’ language competency present in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> Even though Gary has 6 years of professional experience and is certified, he has not worked often with children. Children can have varied language backgrounds and Gary may not have the experience and language flexibility needed to appropriately communicate effectively with the young boy. Bringing a DI into the team would allow for the team to work to verify meaning, gather clarifying information, manage information flow within the team, and affect a mutual monitoring process in the co‐construction of complete and accurate interpretation for all consumers involved.4. What consumer considerations are present in this scenario that would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER: </strong>The consumer is a young child with unknown language competency. He has had limited exposure to American Sign Language and has a home environment that does not use signed language. Additionally, he is the alleged victim of abuse, which may increase his difficulty in communicating with what language he does have.5. Using the CPC for justification, please explain your decision to secure a DI-HI team.<br />
<strong>ANSWER: </strong>The RID Code of Professional Conduct requires interpreters to assess whether or not they possess the necessary skills required for the specific interpreting situation before accepting the work. The CPC also requires interpreters to request the support of a DI when necessary to fully convey an equivalent interpreted message. While the interpreter may be a qualified ASL/English interpreter, because they do not independently have the necessary skills for this consumer they would be making an ethically sound decision to secure a DI.6. Upon completion of your assessment and your determination of needing a DI-HI team, what information would you include to make your case to the requestor that a DI-HI team is necessary?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong></li>
<li>Communication will be accurate and clear resulting in optimal understanding</li>
<li>There is greater efficiency of language access resulting in a more cost effective exchange.</li>
<li>The interaction will be monitored to determine whether interpreting is effective and when it might be appropriate to stop the proceedings and offer appropriate alternative resources ensuring clarity of communication. (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team (2010). Toward Effective Practice: Competencies of the Deaf Interpreter. National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers, page 6)</li>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER:   </strong>Yes.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What about the consumers and their anticipated language use in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Maeve is a bilingual, fluent ASL user. However, she has recently lost her vision and we do not know how this impacts her receptive or expressive language. Also, she is a 17 year old female. The age and gender difference may significantly impact signing variation. As native users of ASL, DIs have had lifelong experiences and exposure to Deaf people with different language backgrounds and with varying cognitive abilities. These experiences have afforded them opportunities to be exposed to and interact with individuals using countless variations and dialects of ASL. From this foundation of language variation and exposure, DIs are able to recognize educational, cognitive, physiological, and sociolinguistic factors and communication needs likely to influence interpretation. Also, DIs can draw from this acquired language base to come up with alternative communication strategies that are creative and flexible enough to meet a variety of consumers’ needs.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What about the interpreters’ language competency present in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Jon has 15 years of experience and is well credentialed. However, we do not know his training or experience with Deaf-Blind or low vision individuals. Regardless, a DI would still enhance the team and access because DIs have had lifelong experiences and exposure to Deaf people with different language backgrounds and with varying cognitive abilities. These experiences have afforded them opportunities to be exposed to and interact with individuals using countless variations and dialects of ASL. From this foundation of language variation and exposure, DIs are able to recognize educational, cognitive, physiological, and sociolinguistic factors and communication needs likely to influence interpretation. Also, DIs can draw from this acquired language base to come up with alternative visual communication strategies that are creative and flexible enough to meet a variety of consumers’ needs.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What setting considerations are present in this scenario that would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> This is a Social Service Setting: Vocational Rehabilitation. Understanding what is expected from VR is paramount; services will be denied or delayed if forms are not properly filled out or regulations, rules, or criteria are not satisfied. Due to the potential significance of this meeting, a DI-HI team should be secured.</li>
<li>Using the CPC for justification, please explain your decision to secure a DI-HI team:<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> The RID/NAD Code of Professional Conduct states that interpreters must assess “the consumers’ needs and the interpreting situation before and during the assignment and make necessary adjustments as needed,” and furthermore, to “request support (e.g., certified deaf interpreters, team members, language facilitators) when needed to fully convey the message or to address exceptional communication challenges.” Given the fact that this interpreter does not have the same level of native fluency and insider acceptance in the Deaf community as would a DI as well as the Deaf person’s loss of vision, an ethically sound decision would be for her to secure a DI to work with her in this scenario.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Upon completion of your assessment and your determination of needing a DI-HI team, what information would you include to make your case to the requestor that a DI-HI team is necessary?</li>
</ol>
<h2>ANSWER:</h2>
<p><em>Summary:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Communication will be accurate and clear resulting in optimal understanding.</li>
<li>There is greater efficiency of language access resulting in a more cost effective exchange.</li>
<li>The interaction will be monitored to determine whether interpreting is effective and when it might be appropriate to stop the proceedings and offer appropriate alternative resources ensuring clarity of communication. (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team (2010). Toward Effective Practice: Competencies of the Deaf Interpreter. National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers, page 6)</li>
<li>Appropriate clarification of culturally based information will occur and will result in a reduced number of cultural misunderstandings that occur.</li>
<li>Due to the serious nature of this settings and the potential for life-altering outcomes, interpreters working in Social Service environments must be confident that their work and conduct is effective, accurate and ethically sound. For this reason, it is considered best practice to collaborate with DIs in legal settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Detailed answer:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The formative skills and experiences described above provide a number of attributes that DIs bring to the interpreted event. These attributes benefit all parties involved. Some benefits are specific to the Deaf consumer. There are also a number of ways that a DI can benefit both the hearing and the Deaf consumer. But, it’s not just the consumers who benefit from a DI.   The HI also benefits from their work with a DI. Here are some ways DIs enhance the communication and overall experience for all participants involved.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Deaf consumers</u> can be confident that:</p>
<ul>
<li>His/her language use will be accurately assessed to determine a target language/communication form.</li>
<li>The DI will use variety of strategies to draw out information and seek clarification of meaning.</li>
<li>Potential gaps (e.g. informational, experiential, educational, visual, protocol, cognitive, memory, cultural, or frame of reference) relative to the particular interaction or setting will be identified in order to determine a target language/communication strategy consistent with the experiential and linguistic framework of the Deaf consumer and appropriate to situational protocol. (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team (2010). Toward Effective Practice: Competencies of the Deaf Interpreter. National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers, page 5)</li>
<li>S/he will be able to express themselves more freely without concern for misunderstanding and/or misinterpretation.</li>
<li>S/he can be less concerned about cultural misunderstandings knowing that the DI shares his/her culture. The DIs’ mere presence will curtail a potential feeling of isolation.</li>
<li>S/he may experience less stress from the positive psychological impact of DI’s presence due to a sense of sameness they share.</li>
<li>The DI will act as a communication advocate to ensure understanding and communication</li>
<li>The DI will apply his/her understanding and life experience of the history and significance of oppression in the Deaf community in analysis of power relationships among participants within the interpreted interaction in order to determine how the consumer’s position within the power dynamic might influence interpreting decisions or strategies. (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team (2010). Toward Effective Practice: Competencies of the Deaf Interpreter. National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers, page 5)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both <u>hearing and Deaf consumers</u> can be confident that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication will be accurate and clear resulting in optimal understanding</li>
<li>There is greater efficiency of language access resulting in a more cost effective exchange.</li>
<li>The interaction will be monitored to determine whether interpreting is effective and when it might be appropriate to stop the proceedings and offer appropriate alternative resources ensuring clarity of communication. (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team (2010). Toward Effective Practice: Competencies of the Deaf Interpreter. National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers, page 6)</li>
<li>Appropriate clarification of culturally based information will occur and will result in a reduced number of cultural misunderstandings that occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hearing interpreter can benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>From seeing their interpretation re-interpreted by the DI and thereby having an immediate opportunity to see a different way to construct the English message, learning new vocabulary and grammatical features of ASL.</li>
<li>From having a second opportunity to view the source information to ensure conveyance of the full integrity of the message.</li>
<li>By having more confidence in the interpreting work being effective and equivalent.</li>
<li>From being part of a team where both interpreters bring their essential skills and experiences to the work to verify meaning, gather clarifying information, manage information flow within the team, and effect a mutual monitoring process in the co‐construction of complete and accurate interpretation for all consumers involved.</li>
<li>From learning new culturally normative ways to construct ASL messages.</li>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>Marnie, a freelance interpreter, has been contacted by the office of Dr. Ann Johnson to interpret for a routine medical procedure. Dr. Johnson’s front desk receptionist explains that they have a Deaf patient, Miss Shannon McDonald coming in for an appointment next week and she is trying to secure an interpreter. Shannon is 25 years old and is coming in for a follow-up to her first OBGYN appointment that took place a month ago. There was no interpreter present for the original appointment and she did not seem to understand the purpose of a pap smear on the day that it was taken. The results came back abnormal and Shannon will need to undergo a colposcopy next week. Dr. Johnson tried to explain the procedure over the phone, but Shannon said that she did not understand the VRS interpreter and would just come to the appointment. She requested an interpreter be provided since she does not know what to expect during the procedure.</p>
<p>Marnie has never interpreted for Shannon, but does interpret medical appointments fairly often. She graduated from an Interpreter Education Program last year and has been interpreting professionally for six months. She is pre-certified and took her certification test last month.</p>

<ol>
<li>Would you recommend a DI-HI team for this appointment?<br />
If yes, continue answering questions 2 – 6; if no, jump to question 7<br />
<strong>ANSWER:  </strong>Yes</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>What about the consumer and his language use in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> The consumer is a young, Deaf female with little experience and knowledge in this health-care setting. Regardless of Marnie’s recent medical interpreting experience, a DI team could enhance her interpreting effectiveness. Because Shannon also mentioned an inability to understand the VRS interpreter, language use may be an issue and a DI would be able to present information in a more visually-centric manner. Because DIs have had lifelong experiences and exposure to Deaf people with different language backgrounds they have been afforded opportunities to be exposed to and interact with individuals using countless variations and dialects of ASL. From this foundation of language variation and exposure, a DI would be able to recognize any linguistic factors and communication needs that may likely influence the interpretation.</li>
<li>What about the interpreters’ language competency present in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> Marnie is still a new interpreter with limited professional experience. Because ASL is not her native language, she could greatly benefit from being part of a team where both interpreters bring their essential skills and experiences to the work to verify meaning, gather clarifying information, manage information flow within the team, and affect a mutual monitoring process in the co‐construction of complete and accurate interpretation for all consumers involved.</li>
<li>What setting considerations are present in this scenario that would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong><br />
The appointment is a follow-up to a previous appointment where no interpreter was present Also, the doctor is expecting to perform a medical procedure the day of the appointment (assuming that the patient provides consent for the procedure to be done). Because the patient has a limited understanding of this medical setting and no understanding of the procedure to take place, it is important that full access to medical information be provided. A DI-HI team would ensure greater interpretation accuracy.</li>
<li>Using the CPC for justification, please explain your decision to secure a DI-HI team.<br />
<strong>ANSWER: </strong>The RID Code of Professional Conduct requires interpreters to assess whether or not they possess the necessary skills required for the specific interpreting situation before accepting the work. The CPC also requires interpreters to request the support of a DI when necessary to fully convey an equivalent interpreted message. While the interpreter may be a qualified ASL/English interpreter, because they do not independently have the necessary skills for this setting they would be making an ethically sound decision to secure a DI.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Upon completion of your assessment and your determination of needing a DI-HI team, what information would you include to make your case to the requestor that a DI-HI team is necessary?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:<br />
</strong>Communication will be accurate and clear resulting in optimal understanding<br />
There is greater efficiency of language access resulting in a more cost effective exchange.<br />
The interaction will be monitored to determine whether interpreting is effective and when it might be appropriate to stop the proceedings and offer appropriate alternative resources ensuring clarity of communication.

Appropriate clarification of culturally based information will occur and will result in a reduced number of cultural misunderstandings that occur.<br />
Due to the serious nature of this setting and the potential for life-altering outcomes, interpreters working in medical environments must be confident that their work and conduct is effective, accurate and ethically sound. For this reason, it is best to collaborate with DIs in medical settings when appropriate.<strong><u>DI-HI Team will not be utilized</u></strong></li>

<h3>Unit 3- Assessing the Need for a DI-HI Team- Additional Settings</h3>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Unit-3-Additional-Settings-Overview.pdf">Download PDF of Unit 3 Overview</a> | <a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Unit-3-Additional-Settings-Overview.docx">Download Word doc of Unit 3 Overview</a></p>
<p>Although three particular settings where DI-HI teams often work are described in this unit, it is also important to recognize that DI-HI teams work in a number of additional settings.  These setting include, but are not limited to: mental health interpreting, legal, public events settings, and national/international interpreting and/or Deafness-related conferences.  Each of these settings is described below.</p>
<h4><strong>Additional Settings</strong></h4>
<h5>Employment settings:</h5>
<p>Deaf people throughout the world work in almost every conceivable type of employment setting. From lawyers, to doctors, to teachers, from technical experts, to computer analysts, to consultants; from factory workers, to constructions workers, to janitorial workers, Deaf people are employed in a vast multitude of settings. In the United States, laws are in place that strive to ensure equal access for Deaf individuals in the work place. The Americans with Disabilities Act, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 mandates access to employment settings, meeting certain criteria, for people with disabilities. Though this is the ideal the country is striving for, it must be noted that there are a variety of factors which may impact the actual provision of accommodations in the employment setting that would allow for Deaf employees to truly have equal access to their work environments.</p>
<p>Interpreters may be asked to interpret for Deaf and Hard of Hearing people in a variety of employment related situations spanning an innumerable array of settings in which Deaf and Hard of Hearing people work. Dependent upon the consumer’s language needs in these environments, a DI may be a necessary addition to the interpreting team. Lack of appropriate access in the work place can result in detrimental effects to an individual. Without clear communication, it is possible for a Deaf employee to misunderstand office policies and procedures, promotion and advancement opportunities, and other important work-related information. Additionally, it is possible for contract negations, employee sanctions, and other legally related information to take place in the workplace, and the need for full communication access in these settings is vitally important.</p>
<p>The NAD/RID Code of Professional Conduct requires that all interpreters carefully consider the assignments that they accept, and part of this consideration process is to evaluate the need of a DI in any setting. If an interpreter deems it necessary to include a DI in an employment environment, they must be able to justify this request to the employer. In employment settings it is also important to be sensitive to the concerns of the consumer when asking for additional interpreters on the interpreting team. The Deaf consumer may have concerns about overburdening their employer with requests for accommodations, so a conversation with the Deaf consumer is necessary in these settings. Additionally, it is important to have clear and concrete justification for the inclusion of a DI so that the employer may understand the benefits of utilizing a DI when interacting with their Deaf or Hard of Hearing employee.</p>
<h5>Mental Health Settings</h5>
<p>As a unique setting with potentially high-stakes results, mental health interpreting requires extensive specialized knowledge, training, skills, and cultural and linguistic competency to effectively facilitate communication among stakeholders. One of the primary challenges in these settings is the fact that mental health professionals depend heavily on language form and content, including subtleties and affective tone, to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3DKvZMflFLdWmFVV2tydVRFTHM/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3DKvZMflFLdWmFVV2tydVRFTHM/view</a></p>
<p>Additionally, evaluations, tests, therapy decisions, and therapy approaches are based on English and hearing norms (Humphrey &amp; Alcorn, 2001). This is compounded by the fact that many mental health providers do not have specific training to work with deaf individuals (Pollard, 2005).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, misdiagnosis of deaf individuals is common (McCay and Daigle-King, 1999). Misdiagnosis of healthy deaf individuals may be due to differing linguistic, cultural, and social norms between the interpreter(s), therapist(s), and Deaf consumer(s). Also, misdiagnosis of deaf individuals who <em>are</em> suffering from an illness or disorder but are overlooked may also occur because of assumptions by the mental health worker, or even the interpreter, of disfluency, differencing cultural and social norms (Pollard, 2005). Due to the complexity and serious nature of these settings, their potential for life-altering outcomes, and so much riding on the nuances of language, culture, and social norms a DI-HI team can be a literal life-line for all involved.</p>
<h5>Legal:</h5>
<p>Legal interpreting can occur in any setting, however, in this course we focus on three distinct settings: courtroom proceedings, attorney/client interactions, and interactions with law enforcement officials. Due to the serious nature of these settings and their potential for life-altering outcomes, interpreters working in legal environments must be confident that their work and conduct is effective, accurate, and ethically sound. “It is best practice to collaborate with deaf interpreter specialists in law enforcement settings because deaf interpreters are able to enhance the accuracy, meaning, and effectiveness of the interpretation” (Stewart, K., Witter-Merithew, A., Cobb, M. , 2009, p.37). There is also legal authority for the use of certified DI-HI teams in courtroom settings. While in other settings the DI-HI team may not necessarily be certified, in statutes pertaining to courtroom interpreting, certified interpreters are explicitly required. The Federal Court Interpreting Act, which oversees the provision of interpreters in Federal courts, states “special interpretation services” are authorized when these services will “aid in the efficient administration of justice.” 28 U.S.C. 1872 (k)(1994). In addition to federal statues, more state laws are now also requiring courts to appoint CDIs to the interpreting team. For a listing of state laws pertaining to CDIs in courtroom settings see Section B (pp. 46-88) in Mathers, C.M. (2009). <u>The Deaf interpreter in court: An accommodation that is more than reasonable.</u> National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers.</p>
<p>Legal interpreting, however, does not only happen in a courtroom. Deaf clients seeking legal counsel may retain the services of an attorney to get expert advice, to prepare for formal legal proceedings, to seek other possible resolutions provided by the law, and for a variety of other reasons. Attorneys work from a specialized body of knowledge and in doing so ensure that all personal or business-related concerns are conducted in a manner that is in full agreement with the laws of the land. Due to the specialized and critical nature of this type of legal work, DI-HI teams serve best in meeting the linguistic and cultural needs of all parties involved.</p>
<p>Additionally, settings with law enforcement individuals are typically high-stakes legal interactions. The consequences of these interactions can have life-altering implications. Investigations, interrogations, and interviews conducted by law enforcement personnel seek to gather accurate and complete information about potential criminal activity. In fact, the way a suspect handles being interrogated will often determine the eventual outcome of a case. For this reason, these types of interactions with law enforcement officers rely heavily on the clarity of the language used in the questioning process. CDI-CHI teams are the best way to ensure that misunderstandings and errors in the interpretation are kept to a minimum. These teams maximize the accuracy and clarity of the message and ensure the protection of the life and liberties of those involved.</p>
<h5>Public events:</h5>
<p>A public event is defined as being “any event open for the general public such as, exhibitions, expositions, fairs, festivals, entertainment, cause-related, fundraising, and leisure events” (http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/public-event/). These events can vary in terms of their purpose and either be a one-time event or periodic in nature. Since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) access to these public events through the provision of sign language interpreters has become a commonly accepted practice. These public venues create ideal opportunities for DI-HI teams because they are typically planned well in advance, and there is ample opportunity for teams to obtain preparation materials, coordinate logistics, and otherwise prepare for their work together. With the DI on stage, participants gain exposure to seeing the work of a DI-HI team in what is typically a non-life threatening environment. Having had this exposure and positive experience, individual participants may in the future seek out the work of a DI-HI team for their own interpreting needs.</p>
<h5>National/International Interpreting and/or Deafness-Related Conferences:</h5>
<p>National and International organizations established by and for Deaf people regularly convene for membership/leadership meetings, host educational and advocacy-related conferences, coordinate rallies, hold public awareness events on human/civil rights topics and other such events. Examples of such organizations are: The National Black Deaf Advocates (NBDA), Intertribal Deaf Council, National Asian Deaf Congress, The National Association of the Deaf (NAD), The World Federation of the Deaf (WFD), and American Association of the Deaf-Blind (AADB) to name a few. DI-HI teams are well suited for interpreting events hosted by these organizations for a number of reasons. As members of Deaf communities, DIs often have direct knowledge and experience with the topics and issues discussed in these forums. This first-hand knowledge allows for both a broad and personal understanding of the meaning, intent, and goals of the participants and leaders. From this base, DI-HI teams can better meet the needs of the participants.</p>
<p>Likewise, National and International Interpreting organizations such as the National Alliance of Black Interpreters (NAOBI), the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID), the Association of Visual Language Interpreters of Canada (AVLIC) and the World Association of Sign Language Interpreters (WASLI) regularly host conferences, meetings and events for their membership. These organizations provide Deaf and hearing interpreters: educational opportunities, ethical and skills credentialing, and advocacy. They endorse the practice of hiring DI-HI teams by showcasing the skills of DI-HI teams working for their hosted events. DI-HI teams can ensure greater access for a wide-range of participants and, in addition, serve as role models as they publicly display the work produced by DI-HI teams.</p>

<li>Deaf consumers can be confident that:
<ol>
<li>His/her language use will be accurately assessed to determine a target language/communication form.</li>
<li>The DI will use variety of strategies to draw out information and seek clarification of meaning.</li>
<li>“Potential gaps (e.g. informational, experiential, educational, visual, protocol, cognitive, memory, cultural, or frame of reference) relative to the particular interaction or setting will be identified in order to determine a target language/communication strategy consistent with the experiential and linguistic framework of the Deaf consumer and appropriate to situational protocol” (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team, 2010, p.5).</li>
<li>S/he will be able to express themselves more freely without concern for misunderstanding and/or misinterpretation.</li>
<li>S/he can be less concerned about cultural misunderstandings knowing that the DI shares his/her culture. The DIs’ mere presence will curtail a potential feeling of isolation.</li>
<li>S/he may experience less stress from the positive psychological impact of DI’s presence due to a sense of sameness they share.</li>
<li>The DI will act as a communication advocate to ensure understanding and communication</li>
<li>“The DI will apply his/her understanding and life experience of the history and significance of oppression in the Deaf community in analysis of power relationships among participants within the interpreted interaction in order to determine how the consumer’s position within the power dynamic might influence interpreting decisions or strategies” (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team, 2010, p. 5).</li>
<li>Communication will be accurate and clear resulting in optimal understanding</li>
<li>There is greater efficiency of language access resulting in a more cost effective exchange.</li>

<h1>Scenario:</h1>
<p>Cami works as one of the staff interpreters at the local School for the Deaf. She has been asked to interpret for a meeting between John, the school counselor, Kylee, a junior at the high school, and Kylee’s mom. Kylee was an honor student until the last semester. Since this time Kylee has been missing homework assignments, acting up in class, and quit playing on the volleyball team.</p>
<p>The counselor, John, is a heritage signer, hearing CODA and has requested Cami specifically for this job. Kylee’s family is hearing and from the Pacific-Islands. Kylee has attended the Deaf School since she was 3 and uses spoken English and some signs to communicate with her mom and younger brother when home. Cami has interpreted for Kylee during various school events and feels she has been able to provide accurate and effective interpreting services in the past.</p>
<p>Cami is not a IPD, though she took ASL as a foreign language in high school. She has a BA in psychology, an MA in Interpreting Pedagogy, and has been certified, NIC: Advanced, and interpreting for 8 years.</p>

<ol>
<li>Would you recommend a DI-HI team for this scenario?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> YES<br />
If no, continue to question #7.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>What about the consumers and their anticipated language use in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong><br />
<u>Kylee’s language</u>: Although Kylee has a hearing family, she has grown up at the Deaf School and therefore it is highly likely that she is a native ASL user. However, we also need to allow for the fact that Kylee may not be fluent because she has been raised in a hearing family that does not sign and there may be disfluent educators at the Deaf School who have influenced Kylee’s language development. With language nuances being so important in the mental health setting, language fluency or disfluency would prove challenging in this scenario.Kylee is young, 16 or 17, and Cami, is at least in her 30s; the difference in age may influence language variation in a way that would be challenging for Cami, a second language learner*. (*Cami may have learned ASL at a younger age but she is still not native.)Even though Kylee grew up at the Deaf School in the United States, she may also have cultural and linguistic variations due to the fact that she is Pacific Islander.<u>John’s Language: </u> Although we do not know which language John will use throughout the meeting, he is a hearing CODA and therefore may be a native user of ASL. It is possible that John would use both ASL, when talking to Kylee, and spoken English, when talking with Kylee’s mother.   As with any mental health setting, mental health professionals depend heavily on language form and content nuances to diagnose and although Cami may understand the overall content of the interactions, the nuances of the language and utterances may prove challenging for a non-native ASL user such as Cami.<u>Kylee’s Mother:</u> We would want to find out more about Kylee’s mom and her language use and needs. However, we do know that Kylee uses spoken English and some signs at home. This would indicate that Kylee’s mom is not fluent in ASL and Cami would most likely be interpreting interactions between Kylee and her mother.   This may prove challenging when considering factors such as language fluency, sensitive or emotionally charged content, intimate register use, and cultural considerations of that Pacific Islanders.Because of the anticipated different language needs named for each of the participants, a DI would be a great asset to this setting. As native users of ASL, DIs have had lifelong experiences and exposure to Deaf people with different language backgrounds and with varying cognitive abilities. These experiences have afforded them opportunities to be exposed to and interact with individuals using countless variations and dialects of ASL. From this foundation of language variation and exposure, DIs are able to recognize educational, cognitive, physiological, and sociolinguistic factors and communication needs likely to influence interpretation. Also, DIs can draw from this acquired language base to come up with alternative visual communication strategies that are creative and flexible enough to meet a variety of consumers’ needs.As identified through NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team (2010) report, DIs have functioned as informal interpreters in settings such as this one.</li>
<li>DIs interpret for their own family members assisting in bridging the communication gaps in a number of everyday life interactions. Kylee is fluent in ASL but her family members are not.</li>
<li>DIs interpret in educational settings for their peers when educators were not fluent users of ASL. We do not know John’s signing fluency and a DI present could be of benefit to him as well.</li>
<li>DIs interpret for Deaf immigrants who were not fluent in ASL assisting them with a variety of documents, forms, issues and situations. Because Kylee’s family does not sign and they are Pacific Islanders, there may be some cultural issues as well as issues of fluency that a DI would understand and know how to work with.</li>
<li>Additionally, as members of the Deaf community/culture DIs have firsthand knowledge of the Deaf-life experience. They have an intrinsic understanding cultural norms, values and constructs of the Deaf community. Through this understanding, DIs are able to negotiate and culturally mediate interpreted interactions where both Deaf cultural and hearing cultural norms and assumptions exist.While cultural membership has immeasurable benefits, it also can come with adverse experiences when the culture is perceived as being outside the majority. Oppression, discrimination and paternalistic attitudes are common experiences among members of the Deaf community. Having personally experienced all that membership into the Deaf culture brings, DIs are able to recognize these cultural dynamics and work from this underlying cultural framework.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>What about the interpreters’ language competency present in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER: </strong> Cami has 8 years of experience and is well credentialed. Although she took ASL as a foreign language in high school, even if she learned from a native user and was active in the community at this time, she is not a native user of ASL. Having a BA in psychology would be a benefit to the team but it does not mean that Cami is an expert in mental health settings. Her MA in Interpreting Pedagogy may also be a benefit to the team in providing insight to both the interpreting and teaming process but does not provide any justification to not request a DI-HI team.Even though Cami has interpreted for Kylee during various school events and feels she has been able to provide accurate and effective interpreting services in the past the mental health setting is a setting with much higher stakes where language and cultural nuances have a greater impact on the outcome.Though skilled and knowledgeable, as a non-native user of ASL Cami would greatly benefit from being a part of a team where both interpreters bring their essential skills and experiences to the work to verify meaning, gather clarifying information, manage information flow within the team, and effect a mutual monitoring process in the co-construction of complete and accurate interpretation for all consumers.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>What setting considerations are present in this scenario that would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<br />
<strong>ANSWER: </strong> The description of the scenario indicates it is a mental health setting. All that we interpret in mental health settings has the potential for high-stakes results. This may include diagnosis, treatment recommendations, patient placement, and the understanding of the consumer of their own mental health and treatment options. One of the primary challenges in these settings is the fact that mental health professionals depend heavily on language form and content, including subtleties and affective tone, to diagnose and treat. A DI-HI team could be the difference between communication vs miscommunication, a successful diagnosis vs misdiagnosis, mental break-down vs good mental health.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Using the CPC for justification, please explain your decision to secure a DI-HI team:<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> The RID/NAD Code of Professional Conduct states that interpreters must assess “the consumers’ needs and the interpreting situation before and during the assignment and make necessary adjustments as needed,” and furthermore, to “request support (e.g., certified deaf interpreters, team members, language facilitators) when needed to fully convey the message or to address exceptional communication challenges.” Given the fact that Cami does not have the same level of native fluency and insider acceptance in the Deaf community as would a DI, an ethically sound decision would be for her to secure a DI to work with her in this scenario.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Upon completion of your assessment and your determination of needing a DI-HI team, what information would you include to make your case to the requestor that a DI-HI team is necessary?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Summary:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Communication will be accurate and clear resulting in optimal understanding.</li>
<li>There is greater efficiency of language access resulting in a more cost effective exchange.</li>
<li>The interaction will be monitored to determine whether interpreting is effective and when it might be appropriate to stop the proceedings and offer appropriate alternative resources ensuring clarity of communication. (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team (2010). Toward Effective Practice: Competencies of the Deaf Interpreter. National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers, page 6)</li>
<li>Appropriate clarification of culturally based information will occur and will result in a reduced number of cultural misunderstandings that occur.</li>
<li>Due to the serious nature of this settings and the potential for life-altering outcomes, interpreters working in mental health environments must be confident that their work and conduct is effective, accurate and ethically sound. For this reason, it is considered best practice to collaborate with DIs in legal settings.</li>

<li>The DI will use variety of strategies to draw out information and seek clarification of meaning.</li>
<li>Potential gaps (e.g. informational, experiential, educational, visual, protocol, cognitive, memory, cultural, or frame of reference) relative to the particular interaction or setting will be identified in order to determine a target language/communication strategy consistent with the experiential and linguistic framework of the Deaf consumer and appropriate to situational protocol.

<li>S/he will be able to express themselves more freely without concern for misunderstanding and/or misinterpretation.</li>
<li>S/he can be less concerned about cultural misunderstandings knowing that the DI shares his/her culture. The DIs’ mere presence will curtail a potential feeling of isolation.</li>
<li>S/he may experience less stress from the positive psychological impact of DI’s presence due to a sense of sameness they share.</li>
<li>The DI will act as a communication advocate to ensure understanding and communication</li>
<li>The DI will apply his/her understanding and life experience of the history and significance of oppression in the Deaf community in analysis of power relationships among participants within the interpreted interaction in order to determine how the consumer’s position within the power dynamic might influence interpreting decisions or strategies.

<p><u>Both hearing and Deaf consumers</u> can be confident that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Communication will be accurate and clear resulting in optimal understanding.</li>
<li>There is greater efficiency of language access resulting in a more cost effective exchange.</li>
<li>The interaction will be monitored to determine whether interpreting is effective and when it might be appropriate to stop the proceedings and offer appropriate alternative resources ensuring clarity of communication. (NCIEC Deaf Interpreter Work Team (2010). Toward Effective Practice: Competencies of the Deaf Interpreter. National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers, page 6)</li>
<li>Appropriate clarification of culturally based information will occur and will result in a reduced number of cultural misunderstandings that occur.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <u>hearing interpreter</u> can benefit:</p>
<ol>
<li>From seeing their interpretation re-interpreted by the DI and thereby having an immediate opportunity to see a different way to construct the English message, learning new vocabulary and grammatical features of ASL.</li>
<li>From having a second opportunity to view the source information to ensure conveyance of the full integrity of the message.</li>
<li>By having more confidence in the interpreting work being effective and equivalent.</li>
<li>From being part of a team where both interpreters bring their essential skills and experiences to the work to verify meaning, gather clarifying information, manage information flow within the team, and effect a mutual monitoring process in the co‐construction of complete and accurate interpretation for all consumers involved.</li>
<li>From learning new culturally normative ways to construct ASL messages.</li>

<ol>
<li>Would you recommend a DI-HI team for this event?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes<br />
If yes, continue answering questions 2 – 6; if no, jump to question 7:</li>
<li>What about the consumers and their anticipated language use in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<strong>ANSWER:</strong> With a large public event such as the one described, it can be anticipated that an event of this nature would draw a large audience from both the Deaf and hearing populations. Because DIs have had lifelong experiences and exposure to Deaf people with different language backgrounds they have been afforded opportunities to be exposed to and interact with individuals using countless variations and dialects of ASL. From this foundation of language variation and exposure, a DI would be able to recognize various linguistic factors and communication needs within the Deaf/hard of hearing crowd and tailor their interpretation accordingly.In addition, because this event could be described as a “Deaf World” event, having a DI on stage for the hearing speakers can provide a sense of relatedness and connection for the Deaf attendees.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li> What about the interpreters’ language competency present in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<strong>ANSWER:</strong> Although Tim is a CODA and a native user of ASL it is likely that he does not have a shared cultural experience of oppression or marginalization with the Deaf community. The celebration of the opening of a center for Deaf seniors represents a place where the dynamics of oppression are minimized and nearly non-existent. For that reason, the underlying significance of such an institution is particularly pertinent to people who are Deaf or hard of hearing. Having a DI on stage who shares common experiences with the audience adds significantly to the cultural mediation process.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>What setting considerations are present in this scenario that would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?<strong>ANSWER:</strong> Because this is a significant event in the local and national Deaf community, a DI-HI team would be well-suited to accommodate the needs of a large Deaf audience. The hearing speakers’ remarks are likely to be scripted and if so, provide for ease in the DI-HI team preparation process. Even without scripts, the DI-HI team can fairly easily predict the kinds of remarks a city official and architect might expect to share in this kind of forum. For this reason, this kind of public event easily lends itself to the work of a DI-HI team.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Using the CPC for justification, please explain your decision to secure a DI-HI team.<strong>ANSWER:</strong> The RID Code of Professional Conduct requires interpreters to assess whether or not they possess the necessary skills required for the specific interpreting situation before accepting the work. The CPC also requires interpreters to request the support of a DI when necessary to fully convey an equivalent interpreted message. While the interpreter may be a highly qualified ASL/English interpreter, because they do not independently have the necessary skills for this setting they would be making an ethically sound decision to secure a DI.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Upon completion of your assessment and your determination of needing a DI-HI team, what information would you include to make your case to the requestor that a DI-HI team is necessary?</li>

<li>Communication will be accurate and clear resulting in optimal understanding</li>
<li>Appropriate clarification of culturally based information will occur and will result in a reduced number of cultural misunderstandings that occur.</li>

<ol start="7">
<li>What about the consumers and their anticipated language use in this scenario led you to your decision not to recommend a DI-HI team?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER:</strong><br />
The consumers in this scenario are ASL users in their 70s. While there may be some language variation that may factor into the interpreting process, given the situation and the couple’s specific request for Jeff to interpret, Jeff should be capable of functioning effectively in this setting without a DI team.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>What about the interpreter’s language competency present in this scenario led you to your decision not to recommend a DI-HI team?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER:</strong><br />
Although Jeff only has 5 years interpreting experience, he is nationally certified. Holding this generalist certification verifies his ability to interpret competently in settings that are not highly specialized with typical Deaf consumers.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>What setting considerations are present in this scenario led you to your decision not to recommend a DI-HI team?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER: </strong>This is a low-impact interpreted event. It is unlikely that the spoken message will be overly complicated or dense. Interpreting at the registration table will be more of a one-on-one interaction. Jeff will have the opportunity to interrupt and ask for clarification if needed. Jeff can request information in advance of the organizers as to what instructions they plan to share before the race. Given this information in advance, Jeff should be well prepared for this job.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Using the CPC for justification, please explain your decision to not secure a DI-HI team.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The RID Code of Professional Conduct requires interpreters to assess whether or not they possess the necessary skills required for the specific interpreting situation before accepting the work. After an analysis of the language of the consumers, the interpreter’s language competency, and the setting considerations it is unlikely that this situation requires a DI-HI team.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>Martha has been asked to interpret for the International Deaf History Conference that’s schedule to take place in her hometown of Ontario Canada. She has been special requested to interpret a breakout session entitled, “The History of Interpreting in Canada.” A colleague of hers who is also an interpreter will be the presenter for this session. Martha has been assisting her colleague in gathering data for the presentation so she is very familiar with the material that will be presented. Although the presenter is fluent in ASL and English, she has indicated that she will be using spoken English for this presentation.</p>
<p>Martha holds a Certificate of Interpretation (COI) from the Association of Visual Language Interpreters of Canada as well as a CSC, a CI and a CT from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. She has been interpreting professionally both in Canada and the US for the last 20 years. Martha is comfortable using International Sign (IS).</p>

<h1><u>Assessing the need for a DI-HI team</u></h1>
<ol>
<li>Would you recommend a DI-HI team for this conference session?<br />
<strong>ANSWER: </strong>Yes.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If yes, continue answering questions 2 – 6; if no, jump to question 7:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What about the consumers and their anticipated language use in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER:</strong> At an international conference such as this, Deaf people from all over the world will be in attendance. Many of them are at minimum, native users of their home country’s sign language, if not fluent in a number of signed languages of other countries. International Sign (IS) is commonly used at these international venues to bridge the communication gap between users of different signed languages. It’s generally assumed that formal IS will be the used by the presenter/interpreter in order to ensure inclusion of as many participants as possible.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What about the interpreters’ language competency present in this scenario would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Martha is certified by both the Canadian interpreting association (AVLIC) and RID verifying her ASL/English interpreting competency. Fluency as an ASL/English interpreter however, does not necessarily reflect an ability to use IS as an interpreter. Because formal IS is expected to be used in these kinds of conference sessions, Martha is not likely to possess the skills to provide an accurate interpretation without a DI working with her as a team.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What setting considerations are present in this scenario that would warrant the use of a DI-HI team?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Because this is an international conference it can be expected that presentations will be academic in nature and require an extensive knowledge and experience with IS in a formal setting. With the anticipated sign language variety of the audience members and their expectation of having access to formal academic IS, a DI would be better suited to meet this diverse language community gathered. In addition, because Martha has extensive background in this subject matter to be presented, she can greatly assist the DI teammate in preparing for their work together.</p>

<p><strong><u>A) Assessment questions: Possible Consumers</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Are the categories of possibly mutually exclusive meaning that the consumers can only fall into one category?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> No. The categories listed here are not mutually exclusive as it is possible to have one consumer with multiple factors impacting their language use.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>What categories of possible consumers are discussed in this unit?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> Semi-lingual/alingual, foreign-born, users of International Sign, DeafBlind, persons with additional or multiple disabilities, minors, persons under the influence or experiencing a traumatic event, and persons with mental illness.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>B) Assessment questions: Educational Interpreting</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What are some of the educational settings that interpreters may encounter?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Birth to three programs, pre-k programs, k-12 programs, vocational training, undergraduate and graduate programs, etc.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In educational settings, do interpreters only provide access for Deaf students?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> No. Services may be required for the Deaf parents or family members attending school functions, educational planning meetings, etc, and it is possible that the Deaf family members will necessitate a DI-HI team.</p>
<p><strong><u>C) Assessment questions: Employment</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In employment settings, why must interpreters be sensitive to the concerns of the consumer?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> In employment settings it is also important to be sensitive to the concerns of the consumer when asking for additional interpreters on the interpreting team. The consumer may have concerns about overburdening their employer with requests for accommodations, so a conversation with the consumer is necessary in these settings.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Which laws mandated access to employment settings?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 197</p>
<p><strong><u> D) Assessment questions: </u></strong><u>Social Service </u></p>
<ol>
<li>Why is access to social service setting more difficult for Deaf individuals?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> With few laws that mandate the use of an interpreter in social service settings access to these services can be difficult, further marginalizing the deaf community.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If hired to interpret in a social service setting the interpreter must be cognizant that _______________ and ______________ interpreting often occurs there as well.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Legal &amp; Mental Health</p>
<p><strong><u>E) Assessment questions: </u></strong><u>Medical Interpreting</u></p>
<ol>
<li>What are the eight medical settings identified by RID’s standard practice paper on medical interpreting that require effective communication and may benefit from the use of a DI-HI team in order to ensure this?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Taking a patient’s medical history, giving diagnoses, performing medical procedures, explaining treatment planning, explaining medicine prescription and regimen, providing patient education or counseling, describing discharge and follow up plans, admitting to emergency departments/urgent care.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Communication problems often arise in medical settings because of a difference in what?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Cultural norms</p>
<p><strong><u>F) Assessment questions: Mental Health</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What makes language use unique in the mental health settings?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>In mental health settings professionals depend heavily on language form and content, including subtleties and affective tone, to diagnose and treat.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Why is it a concern that evaluations, tests, and therapy approaches are based on English and hearing norms?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> If the Deaf person answers questions according to Deaf cultural norms that do not follow or are in conflict with English/hearing norms, the mental health professional may misinterpret the meaning. This may result in misdiagnosis, inappropriate therapy approaches, or have other life-altering consequences.</p>
<p><strong><u>G) Assessment questions: Legal </u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If a HI is requested to interpret for a Deaf witness in a court hearing, how would s/he decide if a DI-HI team is necessary?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the hearing is taking place in a federal court, securing a DI-HI team is authorized by the Federal Interpreting Act which states that, “special interpretation services” are authorized when these services will “aid in the efficient administration of justice.”</li>
<li>If the hearing is taking place outside of a federal court, the interpreter should review statutes in that state to determine if statutory language exists supporting CDIs in court.</li>
<li>Due to the serious nature of courtroom settings, securing a DI-HI team is most always considered to be best practice.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Legal settings can be broken down into three distinct types. Name the three categories.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 1) Attorney/client interactions, 2) interactions with law enforcement officials and 3) courtroom proceedings</p>
<p><strong><u>H) Assessment questions: Public Events </u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What has precipitated an increased demand for access services (interpreters) for public events?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) access to these public events through the provision of sign language interpreters has become a commonly accepted practice.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Explain two reasons why these public venues create ideal opportunities for DI-HI teams.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong><br />
a. These events are typically planned well in advance, there is ample opportunity for teams to obtain preparation materials, coordinate logistics and otherwise prepare for their work together.</p>
<ol>
<li>Participants gain exposure to seeing the work of a DI-HI team in what is typically a non-life threatening environment.</li>
<li>Having had this exposure and positive experience, individual participants may in the future seek out the work of a DI-HI for their own personal interpreting needs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>I) Assessment questions: National/International Interpreting and/or Deafness-Related Conferences</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Describe two reasons why National and International organizations establish by and for Deaf people regularly convene.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:<br />
</strong>a. For membership/leadership meetings<strong><br />
</strong>b. To provide educational and advocacy-related opportunities at conferences, <strong><br />
</strong>c. To coordinate rallies, hold public awareness events on human/civil rights topics and other such events.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Describe one reason why DI-HI teams are well suited for interpreting events hosted by National/International Interpreting and/or Deafness-Related organizations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:<br />
</strong>a. As members of the Deaf community, DIs often have direct knowledge and experience with the topics and issues discussed in these forums.<br />
b. This first-hand knowledge allows for both a broad and personal understanding of the meaning, intent and goals of the participants and leaders.<br />
c. DI-HI teams can better meet the needs of the participants convened.<br />
d. DI-HI teams can ensure greater access for a wide-range of participants and in addition, serve as role models as they publicly display the work produced by DI-HI teams.</p>
